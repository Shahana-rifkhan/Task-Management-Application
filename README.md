# Task Management Application

A feature-rich task management tool enabling users to create, update, and manage tasks visually. Designed for a streamlined experience with drag-and-drop functionality, dynamic alerts, and persistent data handling.

## 🌟 Features

- **Task CRUD Operations**:
  - **Create Tasks**: Add tasks with essential details:
    - Task Name
    - Priority: Low, Medium, High
    - Status: Todo, In Progress, Completed
    - Due Date
    - Assignee (dropdown selection)
  - **Edit Tasks**: Modify task details directly via a drawer modal.
  - **View Tasks**: Group tasks by their status, with dynamic counts displayed.
  - **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with a confirmation prompt.

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**:
  - Move tasks between status columns (`Todo`, `In Progress`, `Completed`) to update their status dynamically.

- **Dynamic Due Date Alerts**:
  - Alerts display the time remaining or overdue status, such as:
    - "Should complete within {X} days"
    - "Should've completed {X} days ago"

- **Persistent Storage**:
  - Task data is stored in the browser’s local storage to ensure it persists across sessions.

- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Automatically save updates to task details without requiring a save button.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - A fully responsive layout that works across all devices.

- **Enhanced UI with Animations**:
  - Smooth transitions and interactions powered by Framer Motion.
